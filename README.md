# MAPX
MAPX, or Motion Amplifying Pixel Transform, was inspired by Michael Rubinstein's research into Video Motion Magnification (http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/vidmag/), attempting to reproduce these results using an open-source implementation of Dense Optical Flow (Farnback, OpenCV) and fast matrix transposition (NumPy).
